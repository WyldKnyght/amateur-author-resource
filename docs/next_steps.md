# Next Steps Summary

- **Verify Local Backend Setup**
  - Test FastAPI app starts and connects with SQLite.[1]
  - Confirm the virtualenv and dependencies are working.

- **Initialize Frontend**
  - Create React project with Vite and TypeScript; run the dev server.
  - Plan folder structure for core components and pages.

- **Implement MVP Features**
  - Add user registration/login endpoints and pages.
  - Build project creation and management backend and UI.
  - Develop the basic character builder model and interface.
  - Add a simple manuscript editor for text input and saving.

- **Maintain Documentation**
  - Update README and docs as new features are built for clarity and onboarding.
  - Note any environmental setup requirements or usage instructions.

Each step should be tackled in sequence, focusing only on one feature or module at a time before moving to the next phase of development.[1]
